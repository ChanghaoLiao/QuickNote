# QuickNote

QuickNote is a tiny Windows app for capturing thoughts instantly — without breaking your flow.

Whenever an idea pops up while you’re coding, writing, or working, switching to heavy note apps can kill momentum.  
QuickNote solves this with a single hotkey: press, type, close, and continue.

No sync.  
No accounts.  
No structure.  
Just write it down and move on.

## Why QuickNote?

Most note apps are great for organizing knowledge — but terrible for *interruptions*.

QuickNote is built specifically for:
- fleeting ideas
- TODOs that don’t belong anywhere yet
- thoughts you don’t want to lose, but also don’t want to manage

It’s intentionally minimal.

## Philosophy

QuickNote is not trying to replace Notion, Obsidian, or OneNote.

It exists *before* those tools —  
at the moment where thinking matters more than organizing.

## Feedback

This is a solo-built project.  
If you have ideas, edge cases, or workflow thoughts, feel free to open an issue or start a discussion.

I’m especially interested in how others capture quick thoughts without losing focus.
